    "- Accuracy = how many predictions were correct.  \n",
    "- Check misclassified examples.\n",

    "#### 7. Discussion\n",
    "- What if we add more features?  \n",
    "- What if data is imbalanced?  \n",

    "### ‚úÖ Recap:\n",
    "- ML = learning from data without explicit rules.  \n",
    "- Know your **problem type**, **data**, and **success metric**.  \n",
    "- ML is more about **defining the right question** than fancy algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üöÄ Next Steps:\n",
    "- Learn more models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM).  \n",
    "- Practice on open datasets (Kaggle).  \n",
